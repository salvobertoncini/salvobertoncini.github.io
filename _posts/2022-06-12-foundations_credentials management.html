<p>80% of the Cyber attacks are related to credentials - Pareto <i>docet</i> -. Credentials are one of the most controversial, misused yet, parts of the security chain which aims to protect services and personal information.</p>

<p>If you're concerned about your passwords, don't panic: <blockquote>people are always the weakest link.</blockquote> (LOL)</p>

<p>What exactly do we mean with "credentials"? How many authentication factor we know and how many of them should we combine?</p>

<p>Let's shine the light on credentials.</p>

<ol data-toc="div.container" data-toc-headings="h2.section-heading"><h3>Table of Contents</h3></ol>

<h2 class="section-heading">Authentication factors</h2>

<p>We refer to an Authentication factor as a group of methods that let a user to prove to an Authentication system that the identity belong to them. As per NIST <sup><a href="#ref">[1]</a></sup> there are 3 authentication factors:
<ol>
	<li>Something you know (e.g., a password, a passphrase, a PIN);</li>
	<li>Something you have (e.g., an One-Time-Password OTP code, an ID badge, a credit card, a cryptographic key);</li>
	<li>something you are (e.g., a fingerprint or other biometric data).</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Passwords are by far the most common, yet one of the most insecure, Authentication method. Despite their reputation, passwords are very easy to use, but they should be managed cautiously.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Password best practices</h2>

<p>Here you are some advices to use passwords, serenely, and securely:

<ol>
	<li>
		Don't share any password to anyone (including your partner, your colleagues, your dog);
	</li>
	<li>
		Create passwords which contain at least 8 characters, including:
		<li>
			One uppercase letter;
		</li>
		<li>
			One lowecase letter;
		</li>
		<li>
			One number;
		</li>
		<li>
			One special character (e.g. !, ?, ., ;, #, @).
		</li>
	</li>
	<li>
		Use a different password for each account you have (your Facebook password has to be different from your bank account password);
	</li>
	<li>
		Periodically change <b>all</b> your passwords;
	</li>
	<li>
		When possible, always use more than a single Authentication factor (<a href="#MFA">Multi Factor Authentication</a> explained here);
	</li>
	<li>
		Use a password manager (e.g. <a href="https://keepass.info">KeePass</a>).
	</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="MFA">Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)</h2>
<p>MFA is at the core of modern security principles. It's a simple habit that greatly complicates the life of the attackers.</p>

<p>It consists of using more than a single Authentication factor to prove your identity:
<ol>
	<li>
		Something you know + something you have (e.g. a password + an OTP code);
	</li>
	<li>
		Something you know + something you are (e.g. a password + fingerprint);
	</li>
	<li>
		Something you have + something you are (e.g. a cryptographic key + facial recognition).
	</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>MFA is a must-have and is <b>strongly</b> recommended for all your accounts, especially the most critical one (e.g. your banking accounts, your accounts related to health services).</p>

<p>Please note: <mark>some MFA methods are more secure than others</mark>. 
	Indeed, if you generate your OTP via an OTP app (e.g. <a href="https://authy.com">Authy</a>) this is far more secure than if you receive the OTP via SMS on your mobile phone <sup><a href="#ref">[2]</a></sup>. This is because of the unsecure nature of SMS: you can be the target for some well-known attacks such as SMS spoofing, SIM swap, social engineering, </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We shed some light on credentials and best practices to manage them, encouraging the use of password managers and Multi Factor Authentication (possibly without SMS).</p>

<p>The more you use this combination of notions, the more secure you might feel.</p>
